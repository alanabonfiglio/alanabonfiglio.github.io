This data, provided by the Lehigh University Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics in Fall 2020, breaks down the Lehigh Class of 2024 by college: Arts & Sciences, Engineering & Applied Science, Arts & Engineering, Business and Intercollegiate Programs. Key findings from this data include the high percentage of Arts & Sciences students and very low number of Arts & Engineering students, implying the high level of interest in Arts & Sciences studies and lower interest in Arts & Engineering studies.
