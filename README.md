  This infographic, “How does the ethnic breakdown of Bethlehem Area School District Public Schools students compare to students in Pennsylvania?” utilized the data source [Public School Review of the Bethlehem Area School District 2021.](https://www.publicschoolreview.com/pennsylvania/bethlehem-area-school-district/4203570-school-district). This data source had a breakdown of BASD students enrolled in the 2021-2022 school year by ethnicity, as well as a breakdown of all Pennsylvania public school students enrolled in the 2021-2022 school year by ethnicity. This infographic utilizes pie charts to compare the ethnic breakdown of the BASD to the ethnic breakdown of all Pennsylvania public schools. Key findings include that there is high Hispanic student representation in the BASD compared to all Pennsylvania public schools and low Black student representation in the BASD compared to all Pennsylvania public schools. Overall, the ethnic breakdown of the BASD is similar to that of Pennsylvania public schools, but slightly more diverse. This implies that the community of Bethlehem itself is diverse and a strong representation of the ethnic breakdown of the state of Pennsylvania. The graphic was created with Canva.

This graphic displays information from [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/19/us/lgbt-rights-milestones-fast-facts/index.html) and [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/stonewall-milestones-american-gay-rights-movement/) about the history of LGBTQ+ legislation in America. It begins with President Eisenhower’s Executive Order 10450 in 1953 and concludes with President Joe Biden’s un-banning of transgender Americans from the military in 2021. This timeline was created to shed light on a piece of history that is often left out of textbooks. It allows us to understand how members of the LGBTQ+ community have been treated under American law. Of course, this graphic does not pay tribute to the thousands of Americans who fought for these legislative changes, but hopefully it influences us to dedicate ourselves to an equitable future.

## Tourism Data
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/alanabonfiglio/alanabonfiglio.github.io/blob/main/chartbuilderhw.png?raw=true" />
 </p>
This chart displays data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gunay01/tourism-datasetcsv) about the five most visited countries in the world during 2000 and 2016. The chart was created using Chartbuilder. Despite 16 years passing between the data collection, the five most visited countries remain the same. The order of the most visited countries remained the same except China surpassed Italy in its number of visitors in 2016. All five countries experienced increases in tourism from 2000 to 2016. This is likely due to the increased accessibility of travel, as plane tickets on average cost less in 2016 than 2000. It will also be interesting to see how the most visited countries change after the pandemic. For obvious reasons, tourism numbers were down in 2020, but it will be interesting to see if people continue to travel less or travel to different countries in the aftermath of COVID-19.

 </p>
This line graph shows us the undergraduate enrollment in Lehigh's three undergraduate colleges over the past five year, indicating the rising and following popularity of various areas of study. The chart shows that over the past five years Lehigh's College of Arts & Sciences has been the most popular of its three undergraduate colleges. It also shows us that enrollment is the College of Arts & Sciences has increased consistently over the last five years. The data shows that from Fall 2017 to Fall 2020, enrollment in the Engineering College decreased. This suggests a declining popularity in Engineering disciplines. However, enrollment in the Engineering college increased from the Fall 2020 to Fall 2021, which suggests Engineering may be gaining popularity back at Lehigh in the next few years. Enrollment in Lehigh's business school has remained consistent over the past five years.

 </p>
This scatterplot displays the GDP and life satisfaction in various countries in 2017 from the World Bank. It is interesting to see the relationship between the wealth of a country and the happiness of its citizens. The chart shows us that countries with higher GDP's tend to have higher life satisfaction rates. While this plot cannot prove causation, the displayed correlation shows that studying whether this causation exists may be worthwhile. This bar chart utilizes data from [World Bank](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction).

This chart allows us to see where high levels of gun violence occur as well as to compare high rates of gun violence between states. This could influence gun safety laws. The chart was made with Chart Builder.

     </p>
This map displays data from [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/earth-media-top-travel-destinations-for-young-people.html) on the top travel destinations for young people in the year of 2018. Travel platform Earth asked over 100,000 millenials “If you could go anywhere on earth, where would it be?” The top ten answers are displayed on this map. This data has interesting implications because the collection took into account where young people want to go, which eliminates typical barriers in travel such as cost. It will be interesting to witness how these destinations change in the coming years as the pandemic’s long-term impact on travel starts to become apparent. This map was made with Google My Maps.
